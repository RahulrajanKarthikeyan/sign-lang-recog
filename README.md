# Sign language recognition
The better network is mnist_convnet, a convolutional neural network made to operate on the data from https://www.kaggle.com/datamunge/sign-language-mnist

The original network is sign_lang_recog_convnet, and it was made to operate on image files with live data enhancement. We never had enough base images for this to work very well.
