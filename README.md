# Sign language recognition
sign_lang_recog_convnet contains the network that utilizes live data enhancement - with our limited dataset, its accuracy has not gotten very high. mnist_convnet was made to operate on csv files containing a much larger dataset. Within only 10 short epochs, the mnist_convnet is able to reach 90% accuracy.
